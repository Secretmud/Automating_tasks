# Automating_tasks

### Important
These are all a work in progress. Keep in mind that you're responsible for anything you do on your computer, if you're uncertain about how to run and make files executable, do not try this. 

## Making executables
I use the following on my computer running Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo chmod +x <filename> && sudo mv <filename> /usr/local/bin
```
You can now run it from everywhere

## Generating setup for cython
An easy way of converting python files to c using cython. Makes it run faster.

## LaTeX
Different tools to create tables etc. This is a work in progress, more will come as I see a need for automating certain mundane tasks.
